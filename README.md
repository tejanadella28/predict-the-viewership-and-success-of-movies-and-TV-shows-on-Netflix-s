# **Netflix Viewership & Success Prediction**  

## **Overview**  
This project predicts the viewership and success of Netflix movies and TV shows using the **RandomForestClassifier**, a machine learning algorithm that provides robust predictions by combining multiple decision trees. The goal is to help Netflix make data-driven decisions regarding content recommendations, production, and acquisitions.

---

## **Features**  
- **Data Exploration**: Analyze the dataset to understand key trends and patterns.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create relevant features to improve prediction accuracy.  
- **Model Training**: Use RandomForestClassifier to classify movies and TV shows into categories like "Successful" or "Not Successful."
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy

## **Dataset**  
Hereâ€™s a detailed description of each column in the dataset:

1. **show_id**  
   - **Description**: A unique identifier assigned to each show or movie.  
   - **Example**: `s1`, `s2`, `s3`  

2. **type**  
   - **Description**: Indicates whether the content is a "Movie" or a "TV Show."  
   - **Values**:  
     - `Movie`  
     - `TV Show`  
   - **Example**: `Movie`, `TV Show`  

3. **title**  
   - **Description**: The name of the movie or TV show.  
   - **Example**: `"Inception"`, `"Stranger Things"`  

4. **director**  
   - **Description**: The director of the movie or TV show. If the director's name is unavailable, the value is `NaN`.  
   - **Example**:  
     - `"Christopher Nolan"`  
     - `NaN` (for unknown directors)  

5. **cast**  
   - **Description**: The list of actors or cast members in the movie or TV show. If cast details are unavailable, the value is `NaN`.  
   - **Example**:  
     - `"Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt"`  
     - `NaN` (for unknown cast)  

6. **country**  
   - **Description**: The country where the movie or TV show was produced or is associated with.  
   - **Example**:  
     - `"United States"`  
     - `"South Korea"`  

7. **date_added**  
   - **Description**: The date when the content was added to the streaming platform, formatted as `"Month Day, Year"`.  
   - **Example**:  
     - `"September 25, 2020"`  
     - `"July 15, 2021"`  

8. **release_year**  
   - **Description**: The year the movie or TV show was originally released.  
   - **Example**:  
     - `2010` (for "Inception")  
     - `2019` (for a TV Show or movie released that year)  

9. **rating**  
   - **Description**: The content's rating, which indicates the recommended audience age or maturity level.  
   - **Example**:  
     - `"PG-13"`  
     - `"TV-MA"`  

10. **duration**  
    - **Description**: The duration of the content. For movies, it is specified in minutes (e.g., `"90 min"`). For TV shows, it indicates the number of seasons (e.g., `"3 Seasons"`).  
    - **Example**:  
      - `"90 min"` (for a movie)  
      - `"3 Seasons"` (for a TV show)  
## **Installation**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://tejanadella28/predict-the-viewership-and-success-of-movies-and-TV-shows-on-Netflix-s.git
   cd netflix-viewership-prediction
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. Run the project:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## **Workflow**  

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and data normalization.  
   - Encode categorical variables using techniques like **One-Hot Encoding** or **Label Encoding**.  

2. **Feature Selection**  
   - Identify the most relevant features using **correlation analysis**, **feature importance**, or **recursive feature elimination (RFE)**.  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Use RandomForestClassifier for training the model.  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Split data into training and testing sets.  
   - Evaluate using metrics:  
     - Accuracy  
---

## **Usage**  
1. **Input**  
   Provide the dataset in CSV format.  
   ```bash
   data/movies_and_shows.csv
   ```  
2. **Run Predictions**  
   Use the trained model to predict whether a movie/TV show will be successful:  
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input "data/new_content.csv"
   ```  

---

## **Results**  
- Model achieves an average accuracy of **X%** on test data.  
- Insights:  
  - Genres with high success rates: [e.g., Drama, Comedy].  
  - Factors influencing success: [e.g., Cast Popularity, Ratings, Budget].
